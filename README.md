# McUsd

This repository has two models that may be submitted to the [USD Working Group Assets repository](https://github.com/usd-wg/assets).

One is in the full_assets subdirectory, "McUsd," a simple [USD](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/index.html) scene geometry with a variety of [UsdPreviewSurface](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/spec_usdpreviewsurface.html) materials applied, for casual material and light testing.

The other is in test_assets, "NormalsTextureBiasAndScale", which is focused on testing three normal map texture formats. Each needs a different bias and scale to be displayed correctly in USD, a feature that is sometimes not implemented by readers. Extensive background on these various formats is also provided.
